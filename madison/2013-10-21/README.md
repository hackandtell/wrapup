# Presentations

I was really impressed by the quality and variety of the projects.
We had several awesome demos of hardware/real-world-interaction, a few gorgeous web apps,
two Clojure libraries, and a coroutines implementation.

## Dan Luu
Dan explained [his simple implementation](https://github.com/danluu/setjmp-longjmp-ucontext-snippets)
of coroutines and channels in C, at hyper-speed.
[The slides are here.](coroutines.pdf)

## Max Rahder
Max showed off his mobile web app for the Hoofer's Sailing Club.
It gives you real time wind, temp, and lake status information, so that you can decide whether to head down to the lake.

## Bradley Grzesiak
Bradley showed of his team's Rails Rumble entry, [Signatry](https://signatry.com/).
The site allows people to re-use [opensource contracts](https://github.com/bendyworks/contracts):
read, customize, and sign them.

## Mystery Person
Someone whose name we didn't catch presented a javascript port of [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async). Pull requests to fix this blurb welcome!

## Timm Murray
Flying things are basically always cool, and Timm's Perl-controlled Parrot drone was no exception.
He demoed his [Perl library UAV::Pilot](https://github.com/frezik/UAV-Pilot/) for controlling the Parrot AR.Drone.

## Matt Feifarek
Matt showed off his gorgeous web app, [Twinkler](http://twnkl.it/), for applying a transformation to images.
It picks the main colors from the input image, and creates a new images of horizontal color stripes based on those colors.
The whole site is beautiful, the demo went smoothly,
and it sounds like he has neat plans for playing with and improving the central algorithm.

## Larry Walker
Larry had the most demos! He showed off an arduino controlled by the computer, a hardware Pong controller,
and a mouse-controlled robot. This was all to show off the power of a HyperCard clone, LiveCode, on top of [Bitlash](https://github.com/billroy/bitlash).

## Jacob Hanshaw
This one took the longest to set up, but it was definitely worth it.
Jacob demoed an early prototype of an Oculus Rift-Kinect virtual reality game.
A later version of the game should appear on [his github](https://github.com/jacobhanshaw).

## Devin Walters
Devin tried to crash a Cesna for us, but it bounced.
He's been playing with the [flightgear Clojure library](https://github.com/dalethatcher/flightgear),
using the eponymous [open-source flight simulator](http://www.flightgear.org/).
