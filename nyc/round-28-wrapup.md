# Round 28: Jeepy Gee

Hello Hackers-

Thanks to [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) for hosting us! As always
Meetup is a great place to hold, well, Meetups, and Tuesday night
was no exception! They're hiring!

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order[0])

### Chris Vickery

Professor Vickery showed off his meticulously soldered Enigma machine which for some reason spits out stock predictions. You should buy AMZN, but only in Philadelphia, when the sun rises from the west. *[It was totally coincidence that we had two cipher machine presentations, but what a fantastic coincidence! -- Ed]*

* [Kit](http://www.jancorver.org/en/bouw/enigma/index.htm )
* [Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)

### Aditya Mukerjee and Greg Tobkin

Aditya and Greg showed us how they cracked the Geheimschreiber machine, which was the successor to the Enigma. *[The Bill Gates of the day said something like "5 wheels should be enough for anyone." -- Ed]*

* [Geheimschreiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geheimschreiber)

### Jonathan Dahan

Jonathan treated us to a NES that actually worked, and a hacked cartridge that recreated an art piece called "Super Mario Clouds" by Cory Arcangel. 

* [Original Piece](http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/supermarioclouds/)
* [Github](https://github.com/jedahan)

### Gabe Ghearing

The frontend developers in the audience were shocked to see Gabe render a smooth, spinning cube in even the oldest of browsers. 

* [Blog post](http://www.foolish-code.com/blog/isocube)

### Rob Spectre

Rob fascinated us with a half terminal of switches to ffmpeg, and the fact that he uses iTunes in a virtual machine on his Linux box to listen to music. *[I said, "whhhaaaaaaa?" He said, "Smart playlists, man" -- Ed]*

But really, he showed us how he built a live streaming rig for broadcasting blizzards.

* [Github](https://github.com/robspectre)

### Omar Rizwan

Cruncher is a calculating notepad. Think of it as a better desktop calculator which allows you to label everything. *[That's a horrible explanation, just go check it out -- Ed]*

* [Cruncher](http://rsnous.com/cruncher)
* [Github](https://github.com/osnr/cruncher)
* [Scrubbing Calculator](http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator)

### Harold Cooper

We were treated to a functional explanation and implementation of Bezier curves, through a demonstration of their construction, in a Haskell GUI program. *[I can't make this stuff up -- Ed]*

* [Github](https://github.com/hrldcpr/Bezier.hs)

### David Branner

David showed off his falsetto while filling us in on his hackery of Google Voice's speech recognition. Turns out, it makes a lot of mistakes.

* [Github](https://github.com/brannerchinese/Gauge_Voice_Transcription)

### Grant Kot

John Williams' jaw dropped when Grant played "The Imperial March" on a digital instrument he invented for mobile devices. Grant showed the Grantophone off once before, but it keeps getting better and better. 

* [Grantophone](http://grantkot.com/grantophone.html)

### Jennifer Refat
