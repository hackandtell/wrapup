# Round 21: We had a hunch

Hello Hackers-

Thanks to [ebay/hunch/svpply](http://www.ebay.com) for hosting us!
The beer was a plenty, and the pizza too. Be sure to bid on tickets
to the next Hack and Tell!

## A sad note...

This month we lost a great member of the hacker community,
[Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com). Among his (long) list of
accomplishments are co-author of the RSS1.0 spec,
[web.py](http://www.webpy.org), early [redditor](http://reddit.com)
(e.g. co-founder-ish), early contributions to markdown, [Open Library](http://www.openlibrary.org),
SOPA/PIPA activist and founder of [Demand Progress](http://demandprogress.org).
I'm sure the list would have continued to grow and grow and grow.

As Aaron was a huge supporter of the [EFF](http://www.eff.org), we
asked you all to donate $5 in his name. I made a donation on behalf
of Hack and Tell today for **$170**. Thanks to everyone who contributed!

Volkan Unsal is putting together a memorial hackathon to help carry
the torch. It's happening at NYC Resistor on February 3rd.

## Even another fun way to spend some time...

Assuming you've read the document linked to in the last wrap up, you
should  basically be an expert on LISP 1.5. With a bit of luck,
you've taken the definition presented on page 13 and mastered the
art of the interpreter. Why not use this new found knowledge and
enter in the [PLT Games](http://www.pltgames.com/)? May the conses
be ever in your favor.

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order[0])

### Andrew Kelley

One theme of Round 21 was "cheating." Although, it is often harder
(and more fun) to cheat than to play the game legally. Andrew
dreams of making a self-aware Minecraft bot, and with Ray Kurzweil
having seemingly endless resources being now at Google, we'd predict
that Andrew's goal will be realized at the same time the Singularity
happens--any day now.

### Marianne Bellotti

We learned from Marianne that Tuesday is the proper time to post to
Hacker News. Maybe one of you can post this wrap up then? [ *Marianne*
*was scheduled to present in Round 19, but was victim to the only snow*
*storm of 2012 in NYC worth mentioning--Ed* ]

### Aditya Mukerjee

Aditya is using [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) to create higher order
music. It's a little fuzzy to this organizer's untrained music brain,
but, if you look at it in terms of programming languages, it's just a
monoid in the category of Bach endofunctors.

### Frank Jania

You might not believe it, but the Hack and Tell organizers aren't
famous, or rich. In fact, you might describe us as "broke" until we sell
out for millions--any day now. We're not sure we'd use "broke" to
describe it, but connotatr tells us that "broke" is seemingly more
"temporary" than "poor", so we'll settle for it.

### Ricky Chang

Playing word games online is tough. It's easy to cheat and even
easier to do so without disclosure. Ricky's Letterpress Bot fixes
the disclosure part. How? Well, you interact with it via Twitter!
While you can't tell your opponent, "I just thought of 'terpsichorean'

### Dan Foreman-Mackey

We bet you often ask your colleagues, "What the fuck is for lunch?" But,
no more! Dan has single-handedly obsoleted those discussions with math.
Take *that*, history!

### Jay Goel

Jay sported his newly improved LED strip suit jacket for us, and showed
us some stuff he's put together using a Raspberry Pi, and an ATtiny85.
To some it sounded somewhat superfluous
[ *as if most Hack and Tell projects weren't--Ed* ], but others brought
forth even more superfluous ideas to go along with it.

The jacket and blinky lights are of course hooked up to twitter, so the
possibilities are pretty much endless.

### Jacek Grebski

This organizer didn't know whether to laugh or cry about Jacek's project.
On the one hand, it struck a chord--thinking back to our early college days
gathered around a tiny monitor thinking, "how the hell is this girl a 7?"

## Final thought...

Nerds, geeks, etc (basically, our people) commonly suffer from
depression. If that's you, please seek help, be it from a friend,
a therapist, a support group. Talk to someone, and get help, please.

Happy hacking,
