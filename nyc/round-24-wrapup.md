## Public Service Announcement

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order[1])

### Matt Spitz

completeme is a python script to auto-complete filenames in a given directory,
much like Github's 't' keyboard shortcut or Command-T in TextMate or
SublimeText. When you've settled on the file you'd like to edit, press "Enter"
to open it with whatever's in your $EDITOR variable or press "Tab" to drop
that filename at the end of your current command.

### Tom Black

R2D is a 2D graphics library for Ruby.  It was built to support teaching people
how to code Ruby and has grown into something that supports many of the
requirements for building games.

* [github](https://github.com/blacktm/r2d)

### Leocadio Tin√©

Dvorany is an Arduino-powered box that enables the use of the Dvorak keyboard
layout in any computer, without having to change the system settings.  Plug it
in and your keyboard will be a Dvorak, simple as that.

* [github](https://github.com/leocadiotine/Dvorany)

### Andres Glusman

Obama V. Reagan is an art project to help demonstrate the similarity between
things Obama and Reagan have said.  The Hack And Tell crew was on point
distinguishing between O and R^2.

### Guillaume Marceau

Rho Contracts is a javascript implementation of Racket's higher-order

### Harold Cooper

Harold built a [mechanical linkage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical)
simulator using numeric.js and html5 canvas.  The software was written to
simulate the behavior of [transformable Penrose tilings](http://syzygy.st/code.html#penrose),
but is general enough to simulate many planar linkages.
