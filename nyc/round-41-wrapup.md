# Round 41: It's the Luckiest (Eulerian) Number That We'll Ever Do

## The Hacks, in presentation order

### Michelle Steigerwalt - Litany Dialog

Michelle demoed a Westworld-inspired UI for the first season finale which scrapes from the user's social media feeds and uses Markov chains to generate new dialog based on the scraped corpus.  It's deployed to a static Amazon S3 fileserver, with all collected user data stored locally in each user's browser.

### Oliver Friedmann - Slack-MFA-bot

Oliver showed us a working demo of the multifactor authentication bot that he created in Node.JS to streamline internal permissions at work.  It allows team members to share MFA one-time tokens (such as for Amazon Web Services) with administrative approval, all on Slack.

### Phillip Schanely - Scenic Overlook

Phillip explained the Model-View problem, incremental MapReduce, and his new in-memory implementation in Python.

### Nat - Onesie

Nat demoed his beautifully over-engineered system for serving static files using Varnish and Google Cloud Storage.  It even generates and handles the SSL certificate for HTTPS!

### Suz - Avr-pizza

Suz demoed her tool and service engine for building Arduino projects in the cloud, which she's used to great effect in her workshops to help people hit the ground running with their robotics projects.  She also showed off some GIFs from [100% Soft](https://100soft.us).

### Anthony Erlinger - Maxwell

Anthony demoed his Maxwell project, a low-level JavaScript circuit simulation engine designed to model, simulate, and render complex electronic circuitry.  He's been working on the project since 2010, during which time some browsers have become efficient enough to effectively render the simulations.

### Rob Bertorelli - Punctuation Parrot

Rob demoed an education Web app which generates sentences with deliberate grammar errors to be corrected by children learning English syntax.  Built using a Haskell backend and a JavaScript/canvas frontend.

## Announcements

### Thanks to our host 

We were back at Dev Bootcamp again, and as always, they were stellar hosts. Thanks to Rob, Melissa, and the rest of the DBC team!  

If you're interested in pursuing teaching opportunities at Dev Bootcamp (either part-time or full-time), email Ryan <ryan@devbootcamp.com> with the subject: Teaching at DBC

Dev Bootcamp is the original, short-term, immersive software development program that transforms those new to coding into job-ready, full-stack web developers.

As an instructor at Dev Bootcamp you'd help provide students a thorough knowledge of software development fundamentals, deliver the metacognitive skills to teach them how to quickly pick up new programming languages, and assist them in cultivating the emotional intelligence needed to land their next job and begin a successful, evolving career as a web developer. If that sounds like something you're into: contact us! Also, if you know anyone looking to get into coding, please tell them about the program. 

### Thanks to our guest co-hosts

With Aditya and Danielle traveling this time, we had guest hosts Michelle Steigerwalt and Veronica Hanus helping out to make sure things went smoothly. Thank you both! 

### Mark your calendars!

Our next meetup, Round 42, will take place on April 20, 2017 at Seamless/Grubhub.

Signups for presenters are open! RSVPs for attendees will open two weeks before the event.
