# Hello Hackers!

Hack && Tell round 34 happened and kicked off H&&T v2.0 !!

Thank you to [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) for hosting the event and feeding us. Eleanor was a treat to work with and we'll be back to say hello again soon enough.

## Projects

### Tom Ballinger - Dalsegno

A browser-based scheme-like programming environment with JavaScript interop that hot-reloads, rewinding its state on code change to the last time the modified portion of the code was run.

### Aaron Schumacher - Gog

gog uses web sockets to separate data processing and data visualization, which lets you visualize any data in a web browser the way you want from any language that does reasonable http.

### Thomas Levine - Svygrep

Survey a file to quickly estimate how many times a particular string occurs. And contemplate how to design surveys for directories of large files.

### David Branner - Braindump

Most Wikipedia pages contain some strange code — a list that is always empty and a class to mark it as such. It turns out that this code has special uses in the subdomains for a small number of languages that use more than one writing system for the same words — Chinese is the most complex example. David illustrated both the code and its application.

### Charlie Deck - Attractors

attractors.io is a web toy Charlie made over a few afternoons that uses webworkers to efficiently render strange attractors to an HTML canvas.

## Fin

I opened the meetup by introducing the new organization team and saying a few things about where v2 of Hack && Tell is going. What I actually said was slightly different, but you can read the original essay for what I said [here](http://jmsdnns.com/2015/08/28/hack-tell-v2-0/)
