Hello Hackers-

Thanks to [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com) for being wonderful hosts!
Plenty of beer, soda, vegan pizza and even some candy! It was a party like
no other, especially thanks to you all.

Sorry for the late wrap up email! We've been too busy obsessing over
[/usr/sbin/powertop](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerTOP) output late at night...

## Public Service Announcement

[CISPA is back.](https://www.eff.org/cybersecurity-bill-faq)

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order[0])

### Aaron Schumacher

Massachusetts' shares its old standardized test questions with
the public. Aaron decided to make them more easily available and in
an interface which allows you to answer them. There's lots of reasons
you might want this as an educator or a researcher, or an educator
doing research. Or, maybe you just want to ensure your as smart as
your 10 year old...

### Bjorne Roche

Bjorne was unhappy with Java's Swing Toolkit, so he did what any
sane developer would do--he built it the way he wanted it.

* [github](https://github.com/bejayoharen/SJWidgets)

### Max Krohn

Max presented an early version of One Shall Pass many rounds ago. He
shared with us the changes he's made since then, which has made it
much more useful for day to day password management.

### Chris Coyne

Asteroids is one of those simple games that everyone in implements at
least one. For some people, it's like the Game of Life--used to test
out different techniques. But, we've yet to see an implementation of
the game as complicated as NodeWar, nor as fun. Implement an agent, and
fight it against another agent. There are no guns in this game
though--guns are boring. You can 3d print *guns*. Just ram each other,
spaceship demolition derby style.

### Jay Goel

We've had something like 4 presentations in the last 3 rounds from Jay.
The man continually does interesting things. I say keep them coming.
This time he showed us how to print labels on a free UPS labels on
a thermal printer.

### Jake Brukhman

Funny story, Jake spent a bunch of time figuring out how to
automatically unscramble [Crazy Blind Date](http://www.crazyblinddate.com/)
images, and his date just did it in MS Paint.

### Francis Gulotta

Francis presented his "Raspbery Pi, Arduino, Node.js powered door
opener" that presses a button so he doesn't have to get up from his
desk. In other news, "Jetson! You're fired!"

### John Threat

What if you, "theoretically," took a bunch of
[exploitable](http://www.trendnet.com/press/view.asp?id=1960) TRENDnet
cameras, extracted a random MP3 out of a YouTube video, and mashed it
up together switching cameras based on the beat of the music? Oh, and
while you're at it, you might as well add motion tracking, 'cause,
well, why not? That'd be pretty cool, right?

* [Everybody Watching Me](http://www.youtube.com/user/everybodywatchingme)

### Nicholas Johnson

Most people probably don't think about where their trash goes. Others
do, and are conscious about recycling and keeping as much of their
refuse as possible out of landfills. But, what if you could *follow*
exactly where your trash goes? Nicholas is attempting to do that, by
throwing out his cell phone.

### Alex Golec

What does it look like when you take pics from /r/circlejerk and post
them on twitter? Surprisingly, it's not *all* porn.
