# Round 25, by Tom Clancy (RIP)

So, uh... I guess this email would've been easier to write last month. Especially since Mr. Clancy was alive then.

Initially, the name was to joke around with how dramatic things sound if you say they're by Tom Clancy. "The Snow Was Falling, By Tom Clancy", and now you're thinking about snow landing on top of a crashed fighter jet on Christmas.

I guess we'd have a fallen drone and some sad operator. "This is where I lost J2D2 2. The first one was in Dumbo, on a dark and stormy night."

What am I even talking about?


# The Ladders

Thanks to John Connolly and The Ladders for hosting the event. We had a great time and the space was awesome.

They're hiring, btw.

They sent John to Strange Loop

## Dan Foreman-Mackey
A new take on replacing Google Reader. You list some blogs, connect your Gmail account and blog posts end up sorted into labels and sublabels in your email. In his words, "It's pretty [fracking] ugly", thus the repo is called "ugly".

# Other Hack And Tells

New spots are Madison, WI and Seattle, WA.

* [Madison](http://www.meetup.com/Madison-Hack-and-Tell/)
* [Seattle](http://www.meetup.com/Hack-and-Tell-Seattle/)

We think it's great when Hack And Tell gets exported, especially by our friends. Both of these cities are lead by Hacker School alums who experienced Hack And Tell before going home and took it with them.

If you have friends in those cities, let 'em know.
