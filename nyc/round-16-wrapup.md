# Rocky had to wrap up his hands after Drago too... (Round 16 Wrap Up)

(While James was out sick^Wabusing the list, I was fighting with my
MacBook (5,1) which no longer boots Debian[0]. So, apologies for the
wrap up's tardiness, but here we go!)

(Disclaimer: There are almost certainly typos, mispelings and other
errors. Feel free to correct them!)

Hello Hackers-

Thanks to Meetup for hosting us again! If you or someone you know
would like to host us, and have room for 75-100+ people, get in
touch!

## Puzzle

We had no puzzle for Round 16. If you'd like a puzzle, I urge you to
write a dictionary data type using no other heap storage but closures.
No one said it had to be efficient. It should support the functions
`assoc` and `lookup` -- Go!

## Projects Presented

### Sam Epstein and Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock

Maybe it's been a while since you've used an Apple II to play your
favorite games from the 80s, but that wait is almost over. AppleToo
is an emulator for the Apple II that runs in your browser. They are
about a disk controller away from being over the top awesome, but
it's seriously impressive right now Too *(see what I did there? --Ed)*

### Jordan Orelli

Hack and Tell is run by two people, one with absolutely no musical
talent, and the other with a lot. Musical talent may be binary, but
the ability to create instruments you cannot play is just a small
matter of programming. Jordan took a Wii-mote, a Novation Launchpad
and some code written in ChucK and did just that. He couldn't play
Keyboard Cat on it, but I still thought it was cool.

### Colin Marc

SPDY is all the rage these days. If you're a Chrome, or Chromium
user, you're probably making reduced latency requests all the time
because of it. But, if you're a programmer and hack Python, how do
you speak SPDY? Well, for now, you've gotta use Python 3, and
Colin's SPDY library.

### Matthew Rothenberg

Mroth is pretty much obsessed with Internet Memes. I met him for
lunch a while back and we talked about Nyan Cat, and hacks related
to it for probably an hour[1]. So, it wasn't a surprise to me
that he presented LOL commits, which is a way to make your git
commit messages fun again. How does it do this? Well, it uses a
git commit hook to take your picture, and plasters your image
with the commit message in Impact (the font).

generate text.

### Sidney San Martin and Thomas Ballinger

You don't typically think of the browser as a real time video
processing tool, but Sidney and Thomas showed us that you *can*
indeed write real-time video processing in Chrome, if you take
advantage of WebWorkers and other optimizations.

AutoAPI lets you take your DictShield models and turn them into
automagicly generated JSON APIs (works with Brubeck).

### Isaac Gonzalez

If you know me at all, you'll know that I'm a huge fan of Scheme
and other Lisp derived languages. So, I was happy to see someone
present their efforts to compile Scheme to JavaScript. The project
is young, but like most things, gets better with age.

## Announcements and things to watch out for

### Hacker School - Summer 2012

I wouldn't normally suggest you go to summer school, but
Hacker School is different. Spend the summer writing code for *you*
and become a better all around programmer. For more information
check out [http://www.hackerschool.com](http://www.hackerschool.com)

### Round 17 -- Coming soon!

Have something you'd like to present? Have a desire to host the
next Hack and Tell? We're starting to plan Round 17 now! Let
us know if you can help!

### Hope Number 9

HOPE is invading Hotel Pennsylvania yet again. This time,
it takes place on July 13-15. For tickets or more information
checkout [hopenumbernine.net](http://hopenumbernine.net).

## Wrap it up

That's it! Hope to see you all at Round 17!

Happy hacking,

Andrew and James

[0]: It now boots OS X again after a grand old reinstall, but I can't
do serious work
     on that monstrosity. If anyone happens to be have expert
knowledge of Grub and
     rEFIt, you know how to find me!

[1]: I'm kidding, we talked about Lolcats, Charlie, and
     Chuck Norris too.
