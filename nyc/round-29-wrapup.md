# Round 29: Last hurrah before we're officially old.

Hello Hackers.

Thank you NYU for hosting the meetup. That was our first time at NYU and the space was great.

## Projects

### Gabe Ghearing

Atari makes a iPad game controller called Duo and you can only use a Duo with Atari games. A whole controller, for just their games. Cmon. Gabe solved that though.

### Sterling Walker	

NYC Open Data publishes restaurant inspection data but the file's formatting wouldn't pass inspection, so Sterling walked over to her computer and wrote a parser in Ruby that outputs JSON.

### Samy Bahra

Samy wrote a hash table in C that out performs Google Dense Hash. It doesn't require locking and is light on memory. 

* [code](http://concurrencykit.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/ck/tree/src/ck_hs.c)

### Jim Grandpre

Jim wrote code that controls a receipt printer to slowly print out every image in xkcd.com/1190. A receipt printer isn't exactly the best in printing technology, so Jim had to figure out how to get around those weaknesses too.

Mind sharing a link for the code, Jim?

### Amy Hanlon

Amy figured out how to quote Harry Potter by replacing Python's import statement with 'accio', which you can see is also 1 less character to type. Magic!

### Vadim Graboys

Snapchat for powerpoint! Someone give this guy a million dollars!

### Dan Foreman-Mackey

Dan built a thing to help him find where he should get coffee in the morning based on how lazy he's feeling or how much he cares about getting great coffee. Also, it works for pizza!

### Dave Justice

This project lets a user upload sounds to a server which then uses the PaulStretch algorithm to slow them down.

### Zed Shaw

Zed wrote the Learn X The Hard Way books and spoke to us about many of the things he's learned from that. A great one is help new coders feel comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and learning by doing.

## Announcements

### Round 30 - The Deliverator

We're always looking for spaces, so if you've got space for 100+ people and are willing to host, please let us know!

### Going to some other place?

There are 1300 people you'd probably get along with that are part of Hack And Tell: Berlin. There's 230 in San Francisco. 300 in Melbourne.

You should reach out to them if you're traveling: [dot org](http://hackandtell.org/)

## Fin

Adios, hackers.
