# Round 42: The Answer

Hello hackers,

Thank you to [Dev Bootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com/) for hosting us - we really appreciate it!

## The Hacks

### Michael Nicholas - Base Converter

Bse Converter is a web app that converts any positive integer between any two base-notation systems, from base-2 (binary) to base-36.

### Shy Ruparel - shy-printer

Shy built a receipt printer that sits on my desk at work and prints out my daily schedule before he arrives. It's setup using python running flask off a raspberry pi. Sadly, he ended up locked out of it before giving his talk, but saved the day by spending his time working together with the whole room to try to hack into his printer in less than 10 minutes! (We totally failed. But it was fun to try!)

### Jack O'Connor - Duct

Duct is an open source library for spawning child processes. It's designed to support wacky bash-style pipelines, with an API that's portable to any modern programming language. Right now there are implementations in Rust and Python.

### Alex Berke - l0v3bot

This is a twitter bot...
Automating lifelong connections,
Disrupting dating,
Pairing potential soul mates whether they want love or not.

### Michelle Steigerwalt - Lightweight JS module system

Michelle taught us how to build a javascript module system, without having to rely on any fancy newfangled frameworks. So if you want to go back in time and release your app a few decades early, now you can.

### Andrew Aldridge - vixrpc

Andrew built a very WIP simple and modern RPC IDL generator for C, inspired by the generally disappointing state of rpcgen & XDR.

### Aditya Mukerjee - ErowidCoin

Aditya showed ErowidCoin, a Twitter bot that posts Markov-powered mashups of Erowid trip reports and reddit comments from /r/bitcoin and /r/btc. Psychedelics are good for Bitcoin.
