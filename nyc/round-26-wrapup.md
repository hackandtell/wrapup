# Subject: Round 26, Wait, really?

Tonight was great.  The hacks were awesome.  The crowd was awesome.
And Ebay *[or however you write it these days--Ed]* was an awesome
host. Like everyone else in NYC, they're hiring, so if you liked the
mural in their lobby *[and who doesn't?--Ed]* you should reach out to
them.

# Call to Action: Rally Against Mass Surveillance

This Saturday (October 26th), there's a *very* important rally happening
in Washington, DC. Get more information at [](http://rally.stopwatching.us).
There are buses to/from NYC being organized, so sign up!

If you can't make it, please consider donating through
[IndieGoGo](http://igg.me/at/stopwatchingus).  Bus tickets are on a
sliding scale, so donations help more people get there via bus, and
help them fund more things in the future.
