# Round 19: Beware of the spooks.

Hello Hackers-

Thanks to [Facebook NYC](http://www.facebook.com) for hosting us! I
always give Facebook a lot of crap, but they were very gracious
hosts and even invited us back!

## A fun way to spend some time...

Implement [RC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4) in your favorite
language. It's not incredibly complicated, and it has many known
weaknesses, but it's a fun exercise in crytographic meanderings.
Then, you should of course share it on the list.

(See my implementation in
[Guile Scheme](https://gist.github.com/4045208). It took 27 minutes
to write and debug (at 5:30 in the morning). See? Quick.)

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order)

### Jay Goel

Jay hates GMail and most webmail clients, but is attempting to
rectify that situation with Hipflask, an MUA over the web that
can connect to multiple IMAP accounts.

[ *I'm very excited about this and would love to have the free time*
*to help out. If you have some free time and hate your mail situation*
*please, please, contribute! -- ed*]

### Bjorne Roche

Bjorne wrote a basic command line guitar tuner so you can be even
*more* nerdy when playing ukelele[0]. We were then treated to an
impromptu concert, in which the singer was a little flat...

### [Last minute weather substitution] Jay Goel

[ *Round 19 was Jay's first Hack and Tell, and was very excited about*
*presenting--he submitted 3 proposals! He got the chance to talk*
*again after bad weather made a presenter cancel. Thanks Jay -- ed*]

For Jay's second act, he showed us his version of most people's
shoddy management of resumes. The punchline is bootstrap, and the
setup is JSON. The climax though, is a very useful tool that could
save many people a lot of frustration when writing a resume.

### [Braindump] Zachary Kanfer

Zach showed us how he won a game of golf by implementing
[K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means) clustering in
[Arc](http://arclanguage.org). Not discussed is how
[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_%28programming_language%29)
really means jibberish.

### Moses Nakamaru

Moses showed us how he used
[parser combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator)
in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) to create an argument parsing
library that doesn't suck so bad.

[ *What apartment did the pirate live in? 2RRRRRRRRRRRRRR! -- ed*]

* [github](https://github.com/mosesn/pirate)

### Aditya Mukerjee

Aditya is a data guy, and he and a few friends hacked together a way
to collect real time sentiment on the presidential debates. [ *Personally,*
*it'd be more interesting to see it hooked up to someone undergoing*
*[Ludovico therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Technique)*
*-- ed*]

### Siraaj Khandkar

Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_life), in
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) (where each cell is a process!),
[awk](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/index.html) and in
[OCaml](http://www.ocaml-lang.org/).

* [twitter](http://twitter.com/ibnfirnas)

### Roman Shtylman

Roman shared with us his ventures into building
[Chrome Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/about_apps.html), which
I guess you could consider Google's take on
[XUL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL)?
His first attempt, a full blown
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client.

## Announcements and Things to Watch out for...

### Round 20 - Coming Soon

We've got two potential spaces lined up, so look for us again right
before the holiday rush!

### Coder Weekly [recycled from last time, but still great!]

I don't get much time to read the web these days, so I've been
relying more and more on a weekly mailing list called
[Coder Weekly](http://coderweekly.com/). It gets sent every
weekend and has a good mix of interesting articles.

## Clouds in many shapes and sizes...

Until next time!

Happy Hacking,

Andrew (@apgwoz) and James (@j2labs)


[0]: Oh just kidding. I too have a ukelele, though I have no musical
talent. On my ever long list of things to do is to learn to play punk
rock covers on it.
