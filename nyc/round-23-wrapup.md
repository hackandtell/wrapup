# Round 23: Tax man came and took my $$$, now all my other bills are gonna be late

Hello Hackers-

Thanks to [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) for being wonderful hosts!
As always, there was plenty of beer, soda and pizza to go around. It's
always great to go back to where it all began (well, 6 floors above
where it all began, but still)!

We'd like to thank the 3 people who shared their Meetup passwords with
us. This wrap up is dedicated to them.[0]

## Public Service Announcement

[FFFFFFFF! CISPA passed the house.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/us-house-representatives-shamefully-passes-cispa-internet-freedom-advocates)

## Projects Presented (in random-pseudo order[1])

### Leocadio Tin√©

Dumbledroid makes it incredibly easy to produce Java classes for
dealing with XML/JSON APIs. It was written primary for use on Android,
but we see no reason to believe it wouldn't work for other
purposes. And, to all the haters, yeah, Jackson can probably do this,
but this one has a *much* cooler name.

* [github](https://github.com/leocadiotine/Dumbledroid)

### Jon Distad

Lisp on an Arduino? Yep. Cool as hell, but the limitations seem to
make it sort of impossible to do real work with it.

* [github](https://github.com/splatspace/wombat)

### Dan Foreman-Mackey

Dan showed off some more really well designed slides. Oh, and he
wrote something that makes pretty silly (but fun!) limericks from
twitter.

* [twitterick](http://twitterick.com/)
* [github](https://github.com/dfm/twitterick)

### Aditya Mukerjee

Pluto is a [planet](http://planetplanet.org) inspired feed reader
that's written in Go, and can be run on a free Heroku instance, with
not much effort. *
[Sorry Pluto, I don't know why people keep picking on you.--Ed] *

### Vijay Pandurangan

About the only use of Foursquare that we can get behind is using it's
data to better enhance something else that's broken, and that's
exactly what Vijay did.  He took Google Calendar's simple location
entry field, hacked up XMLHttpRequest, and tied it to
Foursquare. Requires a browser endorsed by Google, which is probably
it's only fault.

* [github](https://github.com/mitro-co/gcal-autocomplete)
* [background](http://labs.mitro.co/blog/2013/2/16/location-autocomplete-for-google-calendar)

### Aaron Schumacher

If you've ever wanted to analyze the attendance data of NYC public
schools, you might have had trouble. But, Aaron is now archiving it,
so it should be a bit easier going forward.

* [github](https://github.com/ajschumacher/NYCattends)
* [twitter](http://twitter.com/NYCattends)

### Leah Hanson

Leah showed off a ~48 line websockets chat server which utilized the
web framework she wrote in the
[Julia programming language](http://julialang.org).  *
[ Finally! I can write a Fibonacci server[2] in a real language--Ed ]
*

* [github](https://github.com/hackerschool/webstack.jl)

### Grant Kot

It's amazing how much you can do in 998 bytes. Grant produced a tiny
physics engine for simulating blobs. About the only thing that can be
said, is "tubular"--though, that'd be inaccurate, since it uses
circles.

* [github](https://github.com/kotsoft/blob)
* [js1k entry](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1485)
* [adjustable parameters demo](http://grantkot.com/blobs/)

### Braiden Kindt

Braiden wowed us with the design and development of an Internet
accessible Air Conditioning controller which came to be after lots of
reverse engineering, PCB design and lead poisoning. *
[Ok, I made that last part up--Ed] *

* [github](https://github.com/braiden/embedded-ac-controller)
* [overview](http://braiden.org/?p=74)

## A book to read...

[Exploding the Phone](http://explodingthephone.com/) is a great book
which outlines the history of phone phreaking, and while it's at it,
the birth of the telecommunications industry. Pick up a copy, it's
totally worth the read.

### Round 24 - Coming Soon

Though we have a space lined up for May, we're always looking for
space, so let us know if you've got something available!

### Hack and Tell in other cities

1. [Berlin, Germany](http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell)
2. [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/sf-hack-and-tell), organized
by our own Pete Soderling
3. [DC](http://www.meetup.com/dc-hack-and-tell), organized by our own
Jonathan Halcrow

Check out http://hackandtell.org for links, and expect a new
hackandtell.org any year now!


Happy hacking,

to be a simple site which anonymously collected passwords and analyzed
the characteristics of real passwords. However, he realized it was a
bad idea. Who the hell shares their passwords with someone?
