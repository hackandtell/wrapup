# [Round 9: Canned Air Factory](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/179962332/)

It was good times once again on Tuesday at [WeWork Chinatown](http://www.wework.com/location/chinatown/), with five fun hacks all over the software/data/hardware spectrum! A brief wrap-up for the history books:

 * [Michael](https://twitter.com/mvs202) did an amazing amount with canvas, the DC metro map, and pac man. Check out [more information](http://www.mvjantzen.com/blog/?p=670), or just [play](http://mvjantzen.com/metro/map.html?full&night&play)! (Also note that Michael's presentation earned [accolades](https://twitter.com/nancyprager/status/468895481075355648) from passers-by!)

 * [Kevin](https://twitter.com/justmarkham) presented an abridged story of his [experience](https://github.com/justmarkham/kaggle-allstate) in a Kaggle competition. You can see the [director's cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGr1yQV3Um0) on YouTube!

 * [Aaron](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace) talked about living a [cyborg life on Twitter](http://slides.com/ajschumacher/twitter). (Oh god, why?)

 * [Harlan](https://twitter.com/HarlanH) made a [bot](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/member/147520352/) that (who?) is actually useful: [Ballyhoo](http://ballyhoo-hat.herokuapp.com/) for collaborative, persistent meetup announcements. Heroku, node, mongo, postmark, oh my!

 * Glenn, of [DC Robotics Group](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Robotics-Group/) fame, demoed so many [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc/) it was a little bit insane! Congrats to Glenn also for signing a book deal with [Packt](http://www.packtpub.com/) - look for his upcoming littleBits book!

We're working on scheduling the June H&T, so get your hacks in order! :) I'm already looking forward to it - thanks again everybody! Happy hacking!
