#[Round 3: Hack... to the Future!](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/149195962/)


And now, a wrap-up... in random order!


* Mike showed the excellent [audioverb](http://www.audioverb.com/) for all your language in situ needs - and it even has a [youtube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8dx6EBKpTE) too!
* Aaron talked about [rjstat](https://github.com/ajschumacher/rjstat), his R package for reading and writing the [JSON-stat](http://json-stat.org/) data format.
* Fearless leader Jonathan shared a classic Hack and Tell hack for decoding cryptograms using simple language models and SIMULATED ANNEALING! (I know, right?) It's called [cryptosolver](https://github.com/jhalcrow/cryptosolver). We miss you, Jonathan!
* Bayan showed how to simulate fantasy football drafts/seasons in R to test theories and impress your friends! With a [Prezi](http://prezi.com/wthgy9h1mizn/fantasy-hack/)!
* Tom presented not just the JS live-coding [mistakes.io](http://mistakes.io/) but also [super fun interactive statistics](http://macwright.org/play-statistics/) and [simple-statistics](http://macwright.org/simple-statistics/)!
* Aaron also showed this [Guess the Letter](http://ajschumacher.github.io/perplexity/) thing. Oh my gosh there's a [blog post](http://planspace.org/2013/09/23/perplexity-what-it-is-and-what-yours-is/).

And there will be even more good stuff coming soon... to the future!
