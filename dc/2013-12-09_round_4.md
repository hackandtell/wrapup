#[Round 4: The Christmas Invasion](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/153553012/)


Time to wrap up the Christmas Invasion and put a [bow](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/medialibrary/s0/images/episode-promo/s0_01.jpg) on it... Here are all the good things we saw, in non-random order!


* Aaron talked about lots of [graphs](http://planspace.org/nyc-tests/) made from NYC test scores.

* Rick showed a really neat Medicare visualization that he made, which started as a [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) project. ([Cool](http://www.geekosystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bowties3.gif)!)

* [Julian](http://juliangindi.com/) demoed the next big programming language, MyCoolLang aka [Lebowski](http://lebowski.juliangindi.com/), rich with Python and LLVM goodness.

* Chris fought the good fight against lighswitches, automating his home via his [lightbulb](http://www.meethue.com/)s' port 80 (duh).

* In addition to inventing languages, Julian also improves existing ones - he showed how he became a Python core dev and improved performance (timing).

* "So your friendly neighborhood bikeshare station is out of bikes again. What are the odds?" [CHRIS WILL SHOW YOU THE ODDS.](http://cmgiven.github.io/bikeshare-odds/)

* And Joseph showed some of the magic of [salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), and of course [salty vagrant](https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant).


Happy solstice, everybody! See you on [January 13, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/155299672/)!
