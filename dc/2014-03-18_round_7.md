# [Round 7: Thermal Prior Scarab](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/165875312/)

If you're hungry for more wrap-ups like this, including five from DC and 21 from NYC and Madison, WI, check out the [hackandtell/wrapup](https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup) repo on github - there's a lot of coolness there!

It was great to see everyone once again at the inimitable [iStrategyLabs](http://istrategylabs.com/) - here are the presentations in (mostly) tachyon-experiential order:

 * [Julian](http://juliangindi.com/) put a USB [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) in a box with some serious lights and switches - it's missile control for shipping code! [[photo](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace/status/447355770711986177)]

 * [Eric](https://konklone.com/) can give you CSV for that JSON - with a neat [web interface](http://konklone.io/json/) that's easy as Ï€. It does in JavaScript what [in2csv](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/in2csv.html) does in Python ([csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)). [[source](https://github.com/konklone/json)]

 * [Josh](http://razor.occams.info/) wants you to host your own email, and he'll even help you out: continuing the in-a-box theme, he offers [Mail in a Box](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/mail-in-a-box). It's up for the Knight News Challenge, so go and support it!

 * [Kevin](https://twitter.com/KVTaniguchi) scratched an itch, making his work recording student behavior easier. After learning to make an app that creates and reads QR codes and everything, the result is now in the app store: [OoGali](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oogali/id823975095)

 * [Aaron](http://planspace.org/) complained about the over-abundance of [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), but the hack was a simple [Popularity Contest](http://popular.herokuapp.com/). It's frankly amazing the thing hasn't broken yet.

 * Probably the most important presentation of the evening was a bonus from Eric: [Justin Grimes](https://twitter.com/justgrimes) is [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justgrimes.android). This is a game-changer.

We're working on scheduling the April H&T; there are already a couple cool projects on deck. Happy hacking!
