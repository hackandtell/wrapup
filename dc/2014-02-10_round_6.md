It's not PGP-signed, but just trust me: this is the wrap-up for the most recent DC Hack and Tell!

Huge thanks once again to the beautiful people of [iStrategyLabs](http://istrategylabs.com/) who provide such a wonderful home for DC H&T!

 * Aaron showed a great gift for hackers, [Shell in a Box](https://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/). The best thing to come of it is probably this [set of lyrics](http://planspace.org/2014/02/13/official-geekyback-and-ssh-in-a-box-lyrics/) to the hit songs GeekyBack and "SSH in a Box".

 * [Glen](http://gmossy.wordpress.com/) gave voice to a <s>30-year-old</s> vintage speech chip from RadioShack with an Arduino and assorted magic. If you're lucky maybe you can catch one of his upcoming Intro to Arduino workshops! See: [PunchRock](http://www.punchrockdc.com/) / [DC Robotics Group](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Robotics-Group/)

 * eHarmony just got hacked, and now Julian knows whose password is "123456sex". Change your passwords, everybody! ([Julian](http://juliangindi.com/) also wins for most demonstrative demo in the software category.)

 * Rick showed how he wrote a [neural net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) in C to predict the price of silver. There aren't even any [question marks before profit](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit) for this one!

 * J/K [@BeerLabyrinth](https://twitter.com/BeerLabyrinth) came with way more technology than typically used for visualizing beer. If you haven't mixed [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/19j49/t-SNE.html) and alcohol, what are you waiting for?

 * We got to see what Scott's been working on, setting up a system for mentorship. Look forward to seeing more of it in the future!

The next DC H&T is already scheduled! RSVP for [Round 7: Thermal Prior Scarab](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/165875312/) and we'll see you on Tuesday March 18! And don't forget to [submit your hack](http://bit.ly/hackandtelldc7) to present!
