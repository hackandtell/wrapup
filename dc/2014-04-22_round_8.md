# [Round 8: Appreciation Engine ](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/176090722/)

Thanks to everyone who came out on Tuesday, to all our excellent presenters, and to the amazing [WeWork Chinatown](http://www.wework.com/location/chinatown/) for the beautiful space and [keg](https://twitter.com/BeerLabyrinth)! If you're done [identifying](https://www.jetpac.com/deepbeliefdemo) [cats](http://mcphee.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/n/inflatable_unicorn_horn_for_cats.jpg "?"), it's on to the presentations at hand!

 * [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattmakai) bought a phone number and called everyone in the room by coding before our very eyes with [twilio-python](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python). This stuff could form the basis of any number of future hacks!

 * [Michael](https://twitter.com/mvs202) has found something useful to do with twitter! Now you too can [simulate alphabetic execution](http://www.mvjantzen.com/blog/?p=1266) in [the JUDGEMENT of the TWEETS](http://mvjantzen.com/games/tweets.html?peeps=mvs202,justgrimes,planarrowspace,cmgiven,leahbannon,richmanmax,cshenoy,mattmakai,konklone)!

 * [Shannon](https://twitter.com/svt827) has crafted a choose-your-own-artventure [game](http://shannonvturner.com/art/mash) that you can play right now! Museum APIs?! Museum hackathons?! [Naming rights](http://shannonvturner.com/art/untitled)?!?! [wow.](http://a1.s6img.com/cdn/0021/p/7953053_11400835_lz.jpg)

 * [Nick](https://twitter.com/nickmcclellan) brought us into the [DC Action for Children](http://www.dcactionforchildren.org/) [project](https://github.com/nickmcclellan/dcaction) that he leads, making a very cool DC [visualization tool](http://nickmcclellan.github.io/dcaction/). There might still be time to contribute before it's released!

 * [Alan](https://twitter.com/thinkcontext) demonstrated [thinkContext](http://thinkcontext.org/), a browser plugin that proactively adds contextually relevant progressive information to the web. Across so many browsers! [[github](https://github.com/thinkcontext/Think-Context)]

 * [Jen](https://twitter.com/jrullmann) built a whole [tiny data center](https://twitter.com/jrullmann/status/458331827250683904) and she brought it to Hack and Tell! Much fun was had unplugging things and seeing how the [DB](http://www.meetup.com/FoundationDB-Washington-D-C-Meetup-Group/) reacted.

 * [Max](https://twitter.com/richmanmax) stepped up at the last minute with tons of fun [digits of precision](http://richmanmax.com/counters/?title=mobile%20phones%20worldwide&gps=19&tot2011=5400000000) [[github](https://github.com/mjrich/counters)] and a [resume generator](https://github.com/mjrich/resume-generator) made with [faker](fake-factory.readthedocs.org/).

We're working on scheduling the May H&T; there are already a couple cool projects on deck. :) Thanks again everybody! Happy hacking!
