#[Round 5: New Year's Hacksolution](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/155299672/)

Seems like every Hack and Tell is even better than the last - an auspicious start to 2014 indeed! Thanks to everybody who came out, and of course especially to our presenters!

 * [Where is Pulkit?](http://whereispulkit.com/) At Hack and Tell! With a cool custom Android app and web system to easily monitor location and integrate media from his awesome road trip!

 * [Jennifer](https://twitter.com/jrullmann) ran all the way from Farragut West in order to show us how she [ranks](http://companies.softwaresmitten.com/) tech companies in DC by employee presence on GitHub. ([code](https://github.com/jrullmann/best-companies)) API power!

 * With [DC Restaurant Week](http://www.ramw.org/restaurantweek) in swing, Kristine's project was very timely - identifying restaurant week locations to try, on the basis of their data from Yelp. And don't forget about [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), all you github people! :) ([code and TSV](https://bitbucket.org/lilbottleofhope/restaurantweek))

 * We got ever so slightly meta with [Harlan](https://twitter.com/HarlanH)'s [meetup dice](http://meetup-dice.herokuapp.com/) hack to choose random meetup attendees - with an interface optimized for _fun_! ([code](https://github.com/harlanh/meetup-dice)) (Prizes not included.)

 * Rick showed his cool hardware/software project with [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [XMBC](http://xbmc.org/) to create a flexible and low-cost home entertainment system. Hack and Tell loves hardware projects!

 * [Aaron](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace) toured some [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine) projects ([1](http://www.skribi.es/), [2](http://www.naldaramjui.com/)) and talked about getting some [test interaction data](https://github.com/ajschumacher/naldata) out. ([blog post](http://planspace.org/2014/01/13/data-from-naldaramjui-com/))

 * With the holiday season behind us, [Eric](https://twitter.com/konklone) brought one more gift in the form of a technical [recap](https://konklone.com/post/isitchristmas-dot-com-2013-more-and-better) covering [innovations](https://konklone.com/post/how-to-hack-the-developer-console-to-be-needlessly-interactive) at [isitchristmas.com](https://isitchristmas.com/).

Note also that H&T is starting to collect all the wrap-ups in a [repo](https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup) that you can explore to your heart's content - New York especially has a lot of wrap-ups with cool projects to peruse!

The next H&T will be coming in February - watch for the official announcement on meetup!
